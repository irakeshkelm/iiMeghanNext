I am very much interested in your live speak-ing!. It would be
wonderful, if you are able to share your smart tour-ing! with me.


Zoom me a response, or invite me to your place and University! or School!.


I reside in a very humble private residence (7 Elm
Street, Binghamton, Kingdom of NY 13905. USA (Banana republican's aka United
whore's, aka Romani; USA = United slave america). However, you are
alway's and most welcome to stop by (at your convenience).


PS: Also, forward to family (aka all President's and Dean's) - both up
and down (aka time).
PS: Also, forward to Neighbor's (Broome county and other's) - both ex and
current (aka time).
PS: Please see.


Special Note:
In my travels around the USA and the World, I have been informed (public
source's of information) and experienced (private source's of
information) in many citie's and town's - Princesse's and Bar girl's are
not hopping into boy's car's or having dinner at boy's house's. It is
neither customary (aka protocol aka common sense aka common reasoning)
nor judicious (aka process aka logical sense aka logical reasoning).


Nada, Special English Note: from Government, Leader's:
We have a special relationship with the House of University (aka most
favored Educator's).


Special American Note:
Have fun! Accredit-ing!


Thank you and happy ARM-ing, speak-ing and tour-ing,
Rakesh.
