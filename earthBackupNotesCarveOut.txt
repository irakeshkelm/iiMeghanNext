Hi Harvey,


I am having difficulties getting to my doctor's office (Lourdes
orthopedics - Riverside side) on Riverside drive as a consequence of
my disability. In addition, I am having other daily life issues, such
as; getting groceries, going shopping, going to the park, going to the
cemetery and going to the river and hills.


It would be wonderful, if you are able to clear some of my
difficulties and daily life issues.


I have and continue to pursue all avenues (individuals, organizations)
available to me, such as; friends, neighbors, non-profit
organizations, for profit organizations and government.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Please, forward to Chastain, Pastor.


Hi Chastain,


Thanks, for sparing some time and allowing me to offer my services as
a Pastor in residence. Like, I mentioned in our conversation I am
open and willing to fill in the gaps in church services and serve both
the lord and the lay. I am convinced that the lord and lay are both
better served, by the church offering daily prayer services and other
necessary just services as, pantry and supplies to keep the christian
spirit and expand the love of the lord to ourselves and the lay.


Please, pray to the lord and share my prayers with other church
leaders, elders and lay. I give myself to the lord.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Thanks,


for the groceries. Just so you know, some of them were spoiled
(beyond expiry date and beyond edible).


Please, pass my request to meet with the Pastor (thanks for sharing
that you have a Lead pastor - Joe). As, I mentioned, the context
would be to offer my services as Pastor in residence, to both the lord
and the lay.
