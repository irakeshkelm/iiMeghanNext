Special Note:
In my travels around the USA and the World, I have been informed (public
source's of information) and experienced (private source's of
information) in many citie's and town's - Princesse's and Bar girl's are
not hopping into boy's car's or having dinner at boy's house's. It is
neither customary (aka protocol aka common sense aka common reasoning)
nor judicious (aka process aka logical sense aka logical reasoning).


Nada, Special English Note: from Government, Leader's:
We have a special relationship with the House of University (aka most
favored Educator's).


Special American Note:

I have heard from public sources of information that you have an
interest in making the Bible college campus (aka Davis college), put
to public good.


I have an interest in expanding public health, into the Exurban - New
York, Johnson city, NY area. (github.com/irakeshkelm/iirakeshkukatla).


Zoom me a response, or invite me to your place.


Unfortunately, I reside in a very humble private residence (7 Elm
Street, Binghamton, NY 13905. USA (aka United slave america aka Romani america).


However, you are most welcome to stop by (at your convenience).


Thank you,

Hi Harvey,


I am having difficulties getting to my doctor's office (Lourdes
orthopedics - Riverside side) on Riverside drive as a consequence of
my disability. In addition, I am having other daily life issues, such
as; getting groceries, going shopping, going to the park, going to the
cemetery and going to the river and hills.


It would be wonderful, if you are able to clear some of my
difficulties and daily life issues.


I have and continue to pursue all avenues (individuals, organizations)
available to me, such as; friends, neighbors, non-profit
organizations, for profit organizations and government.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Hi Nikki,


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).


Thanks, for sharing your email address. It would be great if you are
able to connect me with getthere at rhnscny.org or other transportation
providers or any friends that might have a car. I have an urgent need
(broken finger) to get to my specialist and hospital.


I did provide pro bono service for about a few months to rhnscny.org
as part of my USA - Corporation for National and Community Service
(Americorps - VISTA) commitment. Mary Maruscak was the person who
showed interest in my knowledge, skills
and abilities for Community health education. Prior, to this I was
interested in USA - Peace Corps.
I did not sign up for this commitment. However, I did end up
providing pro bono service to Mexico on my own for about six months.


I have heard from public sources of information that VINES is engaged in public
good in Broome county. I personally consume mostly - dairy, meat,
cake, chocolate
and syrup. I have not had much of an opportunity to explore VINES.


I have an interest in Expanding and updating the Independent interest,
around earth, moon's, planet's, star's and galaxies.

----- American english - Proper white


Hi Christina and Jennifer,


Thank you, for providing high quality health care in the Binghamton area.


I came across your language assistance (aka Interpreter) sign while
checking in with Stephanie
at Lourdes Center for Psychiatry (184 Court St., Binghamton, NY
13901). Unfortunately, it does not provide language assistance (aka
Interpreter) for the following language variant's.


I am fluent (writing, reading and speaking) in American english -
Proper white, Canadian english - Proper white, Australian english -
Proper white, New Zealand english - Proper white, World english -
Proper white, and England english - Proper white.


I am offering my language assistance service's (aka Interpreter) a la
carte - Contract, per-diem and/or free.


Thank you, Stephanie for directing me to Lourdes - Ascension. Just,
wanted to follow up with an email, on my communication to you, of a
need for language assistance service's (aka interpreter) for American
english - Proper white.


I have a preference for Resident Interpreter's and Manager's (aka fresh
graduates who are in residence training). I also have a gender preference -
female (who have identified in the past, continue to identify in the
present and have reasonable - more likely than not - confidence on
their identity in the future). Please, feel free to share their
profiles and email addresses with me and/or have them communicate with
me directly.


It would be wonderful, to be able to perform conflict of interest and
compatibility check's.


I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Hi Heather,


Thank you, for walking me over to the intake office and sharing your
email address.
It is unfortunate, that your effort's did not bear any fruit - unable to get my
services rolling.


I stopped by ACBC office's a few time's over the past several day's
and was unable to reach you.


Just, wanted to follow up with an email, on my communication with you, of a need
for a Care manager and a Case manager.


I have a preference for Resident receptionist's and Manager's (aka fresh
graduates who are in residence training). I also have a gender preference -
female (who have identified in the past, continue to identify in the
present and have reasonable - more likely than not - confidence on
their identity in the future). Please, feel free to share their
profiles and email addresses with me and/or have them communicate with
me directly.


It would be wonderful, to be able to perform conflict of interest and
compatibility check's. It will be best if we are able to schedule an
appointment
to get my services rolling.


I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.

Rakesh Kukatla - Available for a Second opinion and/or a Care manager
and a Case manager


Hi Hannah,


Thanks for receiving me and listening to me in the shaded and paved area
at ACBC office's. Also, thanks for accepting my request for a copy of
the intake
paperwork and your business card. Thank you for making the effort to get the
paperwork from the responsible party. It is unfortunate, that your
effort's did not bear any fruit.


Thank you, for informing me that you are not in direct contact with
your boss and that
you are unable to provide me with your email address and business
card. Thanks, also for informing me that Heather Launt was
unavailable at the time.


Just, wanted to follow up with an email, on my communication with you, of a need
for a second opinion and/or Care manager and a Case manager.


I have a preference for Resident receptionist's and Manager's (aka fresh
graduates who are in residence training). I also have a gender preference -
female (who have identified in the past, continue to identify in the
present and have reasonable - more likely than not - confidence on
their identity in the future). Please, feel free to share their
profiles and email addresses with me and/or have them communicate with
me directly.


It would be wonderful, to be able to perform conflict of interest and
compatibility check's. I will try to connect with Heather Launt, to get my
paperwork and services rolling.


I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Subject: Fwd: Available for next appointment for Employment and Training Counseling


Hi Laurie and Randall,


Just wanted to check in, with an email.


I have not yet, heard from you about our next Employment and Training
counseling appointment. Please, refer to the email I sent dated
August 21, 2023. I am bringing to your attention that my BC transit
bus pass is dated to expire on September, 9 2023.


Also, I am informing you that BC transit is denying me access to their
buses (with my temporary wheelchair replacement). This is a new
development since our last appointment. I have already informed you,
on my last appointment that poor lice (aka police) took my personal
items (including wheelchair and other) and have not yet returned them
to me.


Please, arrange for medicab (aka medical cab transport) or other
transportation options that you may have available.


Finally, I have not yet received any pickup email from you, for the
phone that you counseled me on acquiring, for communicating with
potential employers, workforce and department of labor career
counselor's and career fair organizer's.


As always, looking forward to and making myself available for our next
appointment, at your convenience.


Thanks again,
Rakesh.

Hi Jennifer,


Thanks for giving me the letter, signed and dated September, 6 2023.
Just, wanted to follow up on my communication with you, at the time of your
deliverance of the letter to me in ACBC office's, of a need
for a second opinion and/or Care manager and Case manager.


I have a preference for Resident Counselor's and Manager's (aka fresh
graduates who
are in residence training). I also have a gender preference -
female (who have identified in the past, continue to identify in the
present and have reasonable - more likely than not - confidence on
their identity in the future). Please, feel free to share their
profiles and email addresses with me and/or have them communicate with
me directly.


It would be wonderful, to be able to perform conflict of interest and
compatibility check's. Again, it would be great if I can pick up a
copy of the intake (paper's).


I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Hi Erica,


Thanks for performing the intake paperwork. Also, thanks for
accepting my request for a copy of the intake paperwork and your
business card.


Unfortunately, you mixed up and delivered the intake paperwork
original's to me, in the waiting area outside the Pantry window and in
front of the Pantry freezer's in ACBC office's. I was and am unable
to accept the originals. Hence, I informed you and left the
original's in the same yellow business envelope on the coffee table in
the above waiting area. Thank you, for informing me that you have ran
out of your business card's.


Just, wanted to follow up on my communication with you, of a need
for a second opinion and/or Care manager and a Case manager.


I have a preference for Resident receptionist's and Manager's (aka fresh
graduates who are in residence training). I also have a gender preference -
female (who have identified in the past, continue to identify in the
present and have reasonable - more likely than not - confidence on

me directly.


It would be wonderful, to be able to perform conflict of interest and
compatibility check's. Again, it would be great if I can pick up a
copy of the intake (paperwork).


I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Rakesh Kukatla - Starlink kit (aka open source kit) and/or TPlink kit
(aka electronical kit)


Hi Elon,


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).


I, was checking out the Starlink kit that comes with Starlink
satellite internet service.


It would be wonderful, if you could open source the Starlink kit
and/or allow me to use a electronical TPlink kit, to connect to
Starlink satellite internet service.


Unfortunately, I own (aka owner) a very humble private residence (7
Elm Street, Binghamton, NY 13905. USA (Banana republicans aka United
whores, aka Romani; USA = United slave america). And, was planning on
using Starlink satellite internet service from my private (aka owned)
property.


Zoom me a response, at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Hi Linus,


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).


I have heard from public sources of information that you have an
interest in ARM-ing! (aka hardware) GIT-ing! (aka sharing), Linux-ing!
(aka Independent interest
and Militia) and tour-ing (aka speaking).


I have an interest in Expanding and updating the Independent interest,
around earth, moon's, planet's, star's and galaxies.

I reside in a very humble private residence (7 Elm

slaves, aka Romani; USA = United slave america). However, you are
always and most welcome to stop by (at your convenience).

PS: Please forward to Tory - Peer Specialist, GBHC


Thanks,


Kristie for scheduling pick up and ride. I enjoyed, the second half
of the ride (Louisa just driving, without any talking - direct or
cross talk). It would be great if GBHC, allows you folks to keep the
ride, that way both going in and coming back. I pray to the lord
every day, that you all, should be allowed to give quiet ride's.


After, the in-coming ride, I had a conversation with Louisa at a table
in the cafe area across from the bowling lanes. Louisa, informed me
that she does not have twenty minutes to spare, for me to go check-in
at the window at CTRC and have a conversation with you. Hence, she
brought me back home (with some cross talk). I prefer silence while I
am in the car.


I made the following request's, to Louisa and I am going to share the
request's, with you, in writing.
1. Please, forward a copy of the referral to me (Rakesh Kukatla).
2. Request to speak with a Social worker (Degree'd - MS, BS and License'd).
3. Request rides from Social worker (Degree'd - Associates and License'd).
4. Please, share profile of Social worker and/or perform
Compatibility and Conflict of interest check's prior to scheduling
appointment's (Degree'd - MBA and Licensed)


Thanks again,

Please, forward to Chastain, Pastor.


Hi Chastain,


Thanks, for sparing some time and allowing me to offer my services as
a Pastor in residence. Like, I mentioned in our conversation I am
open and willing to fill in the gaps in church services and serve both
the lord and the lay. I am convinced that the lord and lay are both
better served, by the church offering daily prayer services and other
necessary just services as, pantry and supplies to keep the christian
spirit and expand the love of the lord to ourselves and the lay.


Please, pray to the lord and share my prayers with other church
leaders, elders and lay. I give myself to the lord.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Thanks,


for the groceries. Just so you know, some of them were spoiled
(beyond expiry date and beyond edible).


Please, pass my request to meet with the Pastor (thanks for sharing
that you have a Lead pastor - Joe). As, I mentioned, the context
would be to offer my services as Pastor in residence, to both the lord
and the lay.
